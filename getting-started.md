## Introduction

To make multithreading work, we need multiple threads ðŸ™„. So if you have a strong interest in something CS-related, please run a thread!! It's a great chance to share what you love with other people, and we need as many talented people helping out as possible! You can run a thread alone or as a team; running a thread will also earn each of you 5 bytes (40 bits).

To get started:
1. Send a _thread abstract_ (see below) to [Vincent](mailto:19songy@harrowschool.org.uk) by **Dec 03, 2023**
2. We'll give you some feedback and ideas
3. Come up with your _thread proposal_ (see below; includes session structure and syllabus) by **Dec 08, 2023**
4. We'll include your thread when announcing multithreading at the start of Spring Term

For what a _thread abstract_ and a _thread proposal_ should look like, refer to the [AI Thread](ai/README.md). We also made a [thread proposal template](thread-proposal-template.md) to help you get started!

## Important Dates

- **Abstract Deadline: Dec 03, 2023**
- **Thread Proposal Deadline: Dec 08, 2023**

## Thread Criteria

You can propose a thread on anything! Just make sure:

- *You love the thread subject, and have prior experience in it*
- The thread is not some front-page Wikipedia content
- Its content does not overlap with an existing thread (Vincent will verify this)
- Ideally, a thread should either:
    - Teach skills useful for later life (e.g. university research, industry); OR
    - Is sufficiently interesting in its own right and contains enough material for at least 8 sessions (e.g. cellular automata)

In terms of practicalities, we are primarily looking for threads that are:

- 20-40 minutes per session
- Around 8 sessions in length
- Focused on making a big difference to 1-4 people
