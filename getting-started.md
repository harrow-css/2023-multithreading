## Introduction

To make multithreading work, we need multiple threads ðŸ™„. So if you have a strong interest in something CS-related, please run a thread!! It's a great chance to share what you love with other people, and will of course be worth bytes (the exact reward scheme is under discussion). We need as many talented people helping out as possible!

It's easy to get started:
1. Send an abstract to [Vincent](mailto:19songy@harrowschool.org.uk) by **Aug 28, 2023** (or make a pull request here)
2. We'll give you some feedback and ideas
3. Come up with your thread proposal (including session structure and syllabus) by **Sep 4, 2023**
4. We'll include your thread when announcing multithreading at the start of term

For what an abstract or a thread proposal should look like, you may refer to the [CP Thread](cp/README.md). We also made a [thread proposal template](thread-proposal-template.md) to help you get started.

## Important Dates

- **Abstract Deadline: Aug 28, 2023**
- **Thread Proposal Deadline: Sep 4, 2023**

## Thread Criteria

You can propose a thread on anything! Just make sure:

- *You love the thread subject, and have prior experience in it*
- The thread is not some front-page Wikipedia content
- Its content does not overlap with an existing thread
- Ideally, a thread should either:
    - Teach skills useful for later life (e.g. university research, industry); OR
    - Is sufficiently interesting in its own right and contains enough material for at least 8 sessions (e.g. cellular automata)

In terms of practicalities, we are primarily looking for threads that are:

- 20-40 minutes per session
- Around 8 sessions in length
- Focused on making a big difference to 1-4 people
