## Abstract

> It's used sooo much everywhere and you should definitely have a brief understanding of it. 

## Targets
- Be able to perform FFT on data (with Python)
- Intro to Data Science, with SciPy, Numpy, Matplotlib, colab etc.

## Session Structure

Brief meet up every Thurs, and work on it whenever throughout the week (using teams). 

## Thread Syllabus

### Week 1
Lecture + intro

### Week 2
Hanning/Hamming window – pitch-preserving acceleration. Shouldn't be much work, nice place to start. 

### Week 3
Signal compression with FFT + 2D FFT on an image
Start with extreme compression techniques which will sound very bad and cause Gibbs effect. 
Then research into JPEG, MP3 and other compression algorithm using Fourier methods, also using the inverseFFT. 

### Week 4
FFT to analyse earthquakes
Many papers on this are available. The US gov provides free earthquake data. Probably going to use spectrograms. A possible direction is to classify earthquakes. 

### Week 5 + 6 (maybe more)
FFT on accelerometer data – step counter
First collect phone accelerometer data (IOS or Android should both work). Using Arduino is possible as well. Then just analyse them with FFT. If everything goes well build an app. 

### Week 7
FFT and convolutions
What makes the FFT Fast, and its applications in CNNs etc.
Just some maths. 

### Week 8
Explore some interesting stuff, e.g. actually doing the math, tower vibrations, IR spectroscopy. 
Wrap up.
