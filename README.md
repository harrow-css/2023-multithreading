## Introduction

CSS Multithreading is designed to **give you the best value for your time**. It encourages CSS members to specialise and continue refining their skills in one area over many weeks. We designed Multithreading as part of a broader effort towards making CSS a learning, training, and collaboration hub, where you can actually engage with topics in a meaningful way and pick up knowledge that's useful for your own projects and futures.

The Multithreading program consists of multiple 'threads' running simultaneously on Thursdays. Each 'thread' goes in-depth about a particular CS topic. For the Autumn 2023 term, we are running the following threads:
* [Competitive Programming](cp/README.md)
* [Artificial Intelligence](ai/README.md)
* [Fast Fourier Transform](fft/README.md)

## Logistics
Threads run during every CSS session on Thursdays:

* For days with lectures, threads run from 5.30-6pm
* For days without lectures, threads run from 5-5.30pm

Threads are 20-30 minutes in length, and consist of around 8 sessions spread out over multiple weeks. 

## Getting Started

> Thread proposals for Spring 2024 are open until Dec 03, 2023!

If you have a deep interest in a particular area of computer science and would like to share your knowledge, we encourage you to start a thread too! Please refer to [getting-started.md](getting-started.md) for detailed instructions. 

## Current Threads

### [CP Thread](cp/README.md)
_Proposed by Andrew Park & Vincent Song_

> The Competitive Programming Thread aims to offer a 10-week, rigorous introduction to the design and analysis of algorithms, similar in level to an introductory undergraduate course. The ultimate aim of the thread is to better prepare attendees (and threads!) for the British Informatics Olympiad and CS interview questions at universities.

### [AI Thread](ai/README.md)
_Proposed by Vincent Song_

> The Artificial Intelligence Thread takes a joint practical and theoretical approach to cover modern techniques of deep learning. It aims to get participants ready to develop their own AI projects!

### [FFT Thread](fft/README.md)
_Proposed by Alex Yi_

> Fast Fourier Transforms are used sooo much everywhere and you should definitely have a brief understanding of it.
