## Introduction

Threads are designed to encourage CSS members to specialise and continue refining their skills in one area over many weeks. In contrast to most past lectures, we actually want CSS members to **learn things**, as part of a broader effort towards making CSS a training hub instead of a theatre. 

Threads run after every CSS session on Thursdays for 30-45 minutes (depending on the length of the lecture before it), and will consistently be led by a few boys. There may be multiple threads, and there may only be 1-2 people attending each — but that’s OK. We are interested in quantity for lectures, but in threads, we focus on quality.

## Important Dates

**Thread Proposal Deadline: Sep 2, 2023**

## Thread Criteria

You can propose a thread on anything! Just make sure:

- *You love the thread subject, and have prior experience in it*
- The thread is not some front-page Wikipedia content
- Its content does not overlap with an existing thread
- Ideally, a thread should either:
    - Teach skills useful for later life (e.g. university research, industry); OR
    - Is sufficiently interesting in its own right and contains enough material for at least 8 sessions (e.g. cellular automata)

In terms of practicalities, we are primarily looking for threads that are:

- 20-40 minutes per session
- 8-10 sessions in length
- Focused on making a big difference to 1-4 people

## Proposed Threads

### [CP Thread](cp/README.md)
_Proposed by Andrew Park & Vincent Song_

> The competitive programming thread aims to offer a 10-week, rigorous introduction to the design and analysis of algorithms, similar in level to an introductory undergraduate course. The ultimate aim of the thread is to better prepare attendees (and threads!) for the British Informatics Olympiad and CS interview questions at universities.
